## Q: Why two players only? Why 2v2?

The low number of players ensures that gameplay is quick and engaging for all participants. The low number of characters minimizes character creation time, while multiple characters per team allows support abilities to shine. Clearly the mode can work with more players or characters but it is not recommended for these reasons.

## Q: Why no feats? Why no Wildemount?

Just for playtesting. We have to balance the spell lists and core first and determine if any subclasses need to be banned before introducing these additional options. Soon!

## Q: Why no UA or homebrew?

The format as-is places a high burden of knowledge on both players. In the interest of bringing new players into the format over time, the format must be kept as simple as possible while still being rich and complex enough for continued engagement. For these reasons I do not recommend UA or homebrew.

## Q: Why this particular drafting method?

The pool of classes in D&D 5E is very small. Having dedicated rounds of player-selected bans may be prohibitively restrictive on the pool. However, picking without bans lacks depth. 

This system where picks are simultaneous and both players making the same selection results in a ban is lifted from DotA 2. It serves as a safety valve on the metagame, where players self-moderate and filter out any options which are "auto-picks."

Also by picking simultaneously and secretly, we avoid issues where picking first or second would provide advantages which are challenging to counterbalance.

After soliciting input from playtesters, the number of classes chosen per draft round was increased from 1 to 2 in order to increase the chance that a ban will occur.

## Q: What inspired this?

I used to be a judge for Magic: the Gathering and really enjoyed facilitating events. I appreciate draft formats the most - they tests skills in card evaluation, deckbuilding, and gameplay all at once. Magic also teaches you that 1v1 is more skill-intensive and faster. When coming to 5E D&D I found it slow and easy. I wanted to find a way to facilitate events with the same speed, intensity, and variety of draft in Magic.

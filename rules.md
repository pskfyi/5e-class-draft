# 5E Class Draft - Rules v1

5E Class Draft is a PvP format featuring on-the-fly character creation followed by an arena combat encounter.

## Overview

This game mode is designed for two players, each piloting two characters. The game has 3 stages:

1) Draft - Players take turns selecting classes for character creation.

2) Character Creation - Each player creates two characters using only the classes they drafted.

3) Combat - Best two out of three; short rest after the first round, long rest after the second round.

This document is presented in the order of these 3 stages. However, in order to make informed decisions during the draft, players should be made aware of the rules for Character Creation and Combat before engaging in draft.

## Draft

A pool of class options is offered to both players. By default, all 12 core classes (PHB classes + Artificer) are available.

Players secretly and simultaneously pick one class at a time. After each round of picks, the GM reveals each player's selection. If both players selected the same class, that class is banned - no one obtains it. Otherwise players obtain their picks. All selected classes are then removed from the pool. This process repeats until each player has obtained 4 classes or no more options remain in the pool.

In the event that 4 or fewer class options remain in the pool, no more bans will occur. Should both players select the same class again, both players obtain that class.

## Character Creation

Players each create two characters using the following rules.
- Level: 4
- Attributes: Point buy
- HP: Average
- Unearthed Arcana: No
- Races: Any official option.
- Classes: 
  - Use only the classes you have obtained during the draft.
  - Subclasses: Any official option.
  - You cannot use the same class on both characters.
  - Multiclassing is allowed.
- Background: None. Characters are limited to their class skills only.
- Equipment: Characters have 0gp. All mundane equipment is free.

### Playtesting Rules

The following additional rules are in place temporarily for playtesting purposes only:
- No Wildemount.
- No feats. No racial options which allow feats.

## Combat

Combat is best two out of three matches. At the end of each match, dead and unconscious characters are restored to 1 HP. There is a short rest after the first round and a long rest after the second round.

The venue is a small arena with a 120ft x 120ft square fighting ring in the middle. Teams start at opposite sides 10ft from the edge with a 90ft gap between them. Leaving the ring counts as an elimination. Flying is permitted, but willingly ending a turn mid-flight, even above the ring, counts as an elimination.

The following additional rules are in effect.
- A player takes all their characters' turns simultaneously.
- Initiative in the first match is determined by the sum of the team's initiative modifiers. Initiative is not rolled.
  - Effects which would grant advantage on initiative rolls instead add a character's proficiency bonus to their initiative modifier.
  - At the start of each subsequent match, the player who lost the previous match chooses whether to go first or second.
- Each character may cast up to one spell before each round of combat.
- Spell material component costs are ignored so long as the caster has a focus.
- Flanking grants advantage.
- The additional Action Options detailed in the DMG pg.271 may be used.
- Actions, including spells, are declared in public. Whether or not a character would/should know a spell is not a factor in this game mode.
  - Readied actions may be privately communicated to the GM. That an action has been readied will still be communicated publicly.
